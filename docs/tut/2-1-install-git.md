Git is a system for tracking and recording changes to files. More concretely, git takes a "snapshot" of your files every time you "commit" them to your repository. If the files have not changed, git stores a link to the previous snapshot rather than recording a new one. This is a system of version control. Importantly allows you to keep a very explicit record of what has changed , and when, and revert to earlier versions if necessary.

Git was developed to allow distributed teams to work on vast repositories of code simultaneously without stepping on each others toes. The code is held in one central repository, and others are invite to access it (or "contribute" to it) from wherever they are. Imagine trying to write and test a computer program by emailing round a document with track changes?! Wouldn't be pretty.

Some computers come with git pre-installed. On others you will need to install it yourself. Follow these instructions to [install git on your computer](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
