I <3 atom

Atom is my fave editor for all types of "code". Python, bash, markdown, html... I've not tried with LaTeX, but I wouldn't be surprised if it can handle that. My guess is it probably can't handle MATLAB, but that's cool. What I love is that I can switch between all these very comfortably (which I have to do a a fair amount for work), and atom takes care of the colours, the spacing, the formatting, linting, the keyboard shortcuts, autocompletions, all the important stuff! I guess that is what you get from a tool developed by and for users who write code for a living!
